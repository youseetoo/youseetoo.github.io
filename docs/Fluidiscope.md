# Fluidiscope

Microscopy is a key tool in many scientific fields, including medical research, environmental monitoring, and materials science. However, current microscopy techniques often have limitations in terms of accessibility, flexibility, and high-throughput sample monitoring. To address these challenges, we developed an ESP32-based microscope with a peristaltic pump module for continuous or controlled flow. It can be used for microplastics, yeast, plankton... find it out! :)

Traditional microscopy techniques often require specialized expertise, expensive equipment, and limited flexibility. Furthermore, high-throughput sample monitoring can be challenging using traditional microscopy methods. To overcome these limitations, we designed an **ESP32-based microscope with a peristaltic pump module*** to enable continuous or controlled flow. The microscope is equipped with a decent camera module for high-resolution imaging and real-time video capture. The peristaltic pump module is added to the microscope assembly using a tube that adapts to the pump. A second ESP32 is used to control the stepper motor 28byj-48, which drives the pump.

# Assembly

We will give you a step-by-step guide how to assemble the fluidics part. The microscope (i.e. [matchboxscope](docs/Matchboxscope.md) remains the same. If anything fails or doesn't match as expected (most likely), please file an issue immediately. We will be there for you.
**Illumination:** Since we wanted to try different illumination scenarios, we added the IKEA USB Lamp to the assembly. It'S powered by the ESP32 USB.

## 3D printing files

All design files can be found in the release from the [Matchboxscope Releases](https://github.com/Matchboxscope/Matchboxscope/releases/tag/ESPMicroscopeCollectionv2) (Look for miniplanktoscope).

All 3D-printable files can be found [here](./STL/Anglerfish_JAR):


## Assembly Process

These are the parts you need

![](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_1.jpg)

Assemble the perestaltic pump. Add the M3x8 DIN906 to the rotating head and mount the 8x3mm bearings:

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_0.jpg)

Screw the Stepper motor to the pump-base with M3x12mm screws

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_2.jpg)

Add the perestaltic head to the motor shaft

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_3.jpg)

Add a tube that fits the assembly (e.g. 5mm silicon), mount zipties to the ends of the inlet/outlet, so that when rotating the motor, the motor, the tube won'T run away

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_4.jpg)

Add the lid and fix it with M3x12mm screws;

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_5.jpg)


The wiring should look like this. Follow this tutorial for the wiring; You can choose almost any pin configuration. The code we will use later can be found [here]:

![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_6.jpg)

The motor will get the PWM signal from the camera and controlls the motor's rounds per miniute acoordingly:
The in1-4 pins on the ULN2003 can be 32,25,22,27 as stated below.
The "analogIn" was chosen to be 4.


In code:

```cpp
#include <Stepper.h>

const int stepsPerRevolution = 2048;  // change this to fit the number of steps per revolution

// ULN2003 Motor Driver Pins
#define IN1 32
#define IN2 25
#define IN3 22
#define IN4 27

#define analogIn 4

// initialize the stepper library
Stepper stepper(stepsPerRevolution, IN1, IN3, IN2, IN4);

void setup() {
  // set the speed at 5 rpm
  stepper.setSpeed(10);
  // initialize the serial port
  Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
  // read analog value from the potentiometer
  int nAverage = 20;
  long valSum = 0;
  int val = 0;
  for(int iAverage = 0; iAverage<nAverage; iAverage++){
    // we use PWM, so we have to create some kind of mean..
    valSum += analogRead(analogIn); // 0..4095

  }
  val = (float)valSum/(float)nAverage;
  Serial.println(val);

  // if the joystic is in the middle ===> stop the motor
  if (  (val > 2000) && (val < 2100) )
  {
    // STOP
    Serial.println("STOP");
    digitalWrite(IN1, LOW);
    digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);
    digitalWrite(IN3, LOW);
    digitalWrite(IN4, LOW);
  }

  else if (val >= 2100)
  {
    // map the speed between 5 and 500 rpm
    int speed_ = map(val, 2100, 4095, 1, 15);
    // set motor speed
    stepper.setSpeed(speed_);

    // move the motor (1 step)
    stepper.step(1);
  }

  // move the motor in the other direction
  else
  {
    // map the speed between 5 and 500 rpm
    int speed_ = map(val, 2000, 0, 1, 15);
    // set motor speed
    stepper.setSpeed(speed_);

    // move the motor (1 step)
    stepper.step(-1);
  }
}
```


Make sure the motor runs freely (for this, simply connect the motor driver board to the ESP, e.g. following this [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-stepper-motor-28byj-48-uln2003/) and try a sample code for teh arduio IDE)

Hide all the cables

Put it close together, organize the wires and tubes
![Start](IMAGES/fluidicscope/fluidiscope_8.jpg)

Add the tube and make sure the wires are leaving the assembly like this:

### Some thoughts on the Ikea Lamp

This is inspired by the https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5167475 design, where Dupont cable were added to a 3D printed assembly in order to mimic a female USB plug. To be honest, it's much more straightforward to simply by a female adapter and solder it to the board using some wires - but: I didn't have one, so I created this layer for the lamp. It wasn't straightforward to add the ikea lamp - so: **WARNING** Better buy one of these and solder it to the ESP 5V/GND :)
